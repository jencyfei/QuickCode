You are Claude, an AI assistant. Your task is to generate a complete HTML page that simulates the redesigned Android app screen for "快速取件码" (Quick Pickup Codes) based on the following detailed design specification provided by a frontend engineer and product manager. The HTML should be a static web page that mimics the mobile app UI as closely as possible, using HTML, CSS, and optionally JavaScript for basic interactions like checkboxes, button enabling/disabling, and simple alerts/toasts for operations (e.g., copy and pickup actions). Aim for a responsive design that looks good on mobile screens (e.g., width around 360px).

### Original Context
The original app page displays pickup code information for express deliveries, including pickup date, code, address, and time. It supports batch copying of codes and batch updating of package status to "picked up". The redesign enhances usability, adds multi-select, and improves layout.

### Design Principles
- Simplicity: Avoid information overload; display only essential fields.
- Interactivity: Support multi-select with checkboxes; batch buttons; individual actions for flexibility.
- Extensibility: Use a list that can handle multiple items (e.g., scrollable).
- Security: For "pickup" actions, simulate a confirmation dialog.
- Internationalization: Support Chinese text; proper alignment.
- Use Material Design-inspired elements: Cards for list items, filled buttons, icons (use Material Icons or simple emojis if needed).
- Color scheme: Primary blue-purple (#673AB7 or similar), light background (#F3F3F3), white cards.

### Page Layout Description
Use a vertical layout. Top: AppBar. Middle: Scrollable list. Bottom: Action bar (fixed or sticky).

1. **Top AppBar (Header)**:
   - Title: "快速取件码" (centered, font-size: 24px, bold).
   - Left: Back icon (e.g., arrow-left, optional link).
   - Right: Settings icon (gear).
   - Below: Summary line like "今日取件：2件" (font-size: 18px, blue highlight), next to a "全选" checkbox (label: "全选").

2. **Main List (Scrollable Section)**:
   - Use a list of card elements (e.g., <div class="card"> with box-shadow, border-radius: 8px, background: white, margin: 8px).
   - Each item (repeat for at least 2 sample items based on original data):
     - Top row: Checkbox (left) + Pickup date (e.g., "6-5", font-size: 20px, bold) + Time (e.g., "12:42:25", right, gray, 12px).
     - Middle: Pickup code large display (e.g., "6-5-3002", font-size: 32px, center-aligned, blue highlight).
     - Bottom: Address (e.g., "郑州北文雅小区6号楼102层", font-size: 16px, multi-line, with a location pin icon).
     - Right side: Two icon buttons – Copy icon (e.g., content_copy) and Pickup icon (e.g., box or check_circle).
   - Sample data for items:
     - Item 1: Date "6-5", Code "6-5-3002", Address "郑州北文雅小区6号楼102层", Time "12:42:25".
     - Item 2: Date "6-2", Code "6-2-3006", Address "郑州北文雅小区6号楼102层", Time "12:42:25".
   - If empty: Show "暂无取件码" with a refresh button.
   - Spacing: 8px between cards.

3. **Bottom Action Bar (Fixed Bottom)**:
   - Two buttons:
     - "批量复制" (left, filled button, icon: copy, onclick: simulate copy selected codes to clipboard or alert "已复制X个码").
     - "批量取出" (right, filled button, icon: box, onclick: simulate update, confirm dialog, alert "已更新X个快递", and perhaps gray out selected items).
   - Disable buttons (grayed out) if no items selected.
   - Optional: Floating add button (+) for new codes.

### Interaction Flow (Implement with JS)
- On page load: Load sample list items.
- Multi-select: Clicking "全选" checks/unchecks all; individual checkboxes update selection count.
- Individual actions: Copy button on item – alert "已复制码: [code]"; Pickup button – confirm "确认取出？", then gray out item or remove.
- Batch actions: Check selected items; enable buttons; on click, process selected (e.g., collect codes, alert).
- Animations: Optional fade-in for items (CSS transitions).
- Error handling: Not critical for simulation, but add a snackbar-like div for messages.

### Technical Suggestions for HTML Implementation
- Structure: Use <header> for top, <main> for list (ul/li or divs), <footer> for bottom.
- CSS: Responsive (media queries for mobile), flexbox/grid for layouts.
- JS: Use vanilla JS for event listeners (checkbox changes, button clicks). For copy, use navigator.clipboard if possible, else alert.
- Icons: Include Google Material Icons (<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons" rel="stylesheet">) or Font Awesome.
- Data model: Simulate with JS array of objects: {date, code, address, time, selected: false}.
- Empty state: Conditional display.
- Refresh: Optional pull-to-refresh simulation not needed; just a button.

### Product Improvements (For Reference, Not Mandatory in HTML)
- A/B testing ideas, future features like QR scan, maps, notifications – mention in comments if relevant.

Generate the full HTML code in a single <html> document, including <head> with styles and scripts. Make it self-contained and runnable in a browser. Output only the HTML code, wrapped in a code block for easy copy-paste. If needed, add comments in the code explaining sections.
